# Serper Plugin for Spora

Adds **Google Search** to [Spora](https://github.com/spora-ai/Spora) agents
via the [Serper.dev](https://serper.dev) REST API. One tool, nine operations
covering web, images, news, videos, scholar, shopping, patents, maps, and
places — backed by structured Google results (organic, knowledge graph,
"people also ask", answer box, related searches, image/news/video blocks).

## Installation

```bash
php bin/spora plugin:install spora-ai/spora-plugin-serper
```

For local development against a sibling checkout, pass `--path=/abs/path/to/checkout`.

After install the tool `serper_search` is registered with nine operations. Pick an operation by passing `"operation": "<name>"` to the tool — see [Per-tool operations](#per-tool-operations).

## Configuration

Settings → Tools → Serper Search. Sign up at <https://serper.dev> to obtain
an API key (2,500 free queries on signup). Serper.dev is the upstream
source — this plugin is a thin PHP wrapper, not a search engine.

| Setting | Required | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `api_key` | yes | — |
| `http_timeout` | no | `30` (seconds; falls back to `SPORA_TOOL_HTTP_TIMEOUT` env) |

`api_key` is encrypted at rest by Spora's `ToolConfigService`, masked in the
UI, and never logged. The plugin uses the public endpoint
`https://google.serper.dev` (hard-coded in `makeSerperRequest`; not
overridable in v1) and authenticates every call with an `X-API-KEY` header.
Rate limits and per-second quotas are governed by your Serper.dev plan —
Spora does not throttle on top of that.

## Per-tool operations

The plugin ships one tool, `serper_search`, that dispatches on an
`operation` parameter to one of nine Serper.dev endpoints. Every operation
takes a single required `q` (the search query string) and POSTs JSON to the
matching path under `https://google.serper.dev`. Responses are normalised
into a human-readable numbered list the agent can quote or cite.

| Operation | Endpoint | What it returns |
|---|---|---|
| `search` | `POST /search` | Organic results, answer box / knowledge graph snippet |
| `image_search` | `POST /images` | Image results with `imageUrl`, `sourceUrl`, `sourceName` |
| `news_search` | `POST /news` | News articles with source, date, snippet |
| `video_search` | `POST /videos` | Video results with source, date, snippet |
| `scholar_search` | `POST /scholar` | Scholarly papers with title, link, snippet, `publicationInfo` |
| `shopping_search` | `POST /shopping` | Product results with source, price, snippet |
| `patents_search` | `POST /patents` | Patent records with `patentId`, date, snippet |
| `maps_search` | `POST /maps` | Local map results with address, phone, rating, hours, website |
| `places_search` | `POST /places` | Detailed place records with type, opening hours, website, URL |

All operations accept the same base Serper.dev parameters (`q` is the only
one surfaced through the tool today — `gl`, `hl`, `num`, `page`, and
`autocorrect` are accepted by the upstream API but not yet exposed through
the tool's argument schema). Endpoint coverage matches
[Serper.dev's endpoint list](https://serper.dev).

## Development

```bash
composer install
./vendor/bin/pest
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --no-progress
./vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix --dry-run --diff
```

CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — Pest on PHP 8.4, PHPStan analysis,
php-cs-fixer dry-run. A separate `coverage` job runs Pest with `pcov` and
uploads `coverage.xml` + JUnit; the `sonar` job uploads both to SonarCloud
(project key `spora-ai_spora-plugin-serper`), so the `new_coverage` metric is
measurable per PR. Requires the `SONAR_TOKEN` secret in the repo.
